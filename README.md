# Discord Bot


The main code of a discord bot that I made for my own server. For now, it sends quotes in keywords chosen by user. Quotes were taken from [zen quotes](https://zenquotes.io). Zen quotes have many more keywords than I used for this bot, I limited them and created a list. This is my first trial so, this project to be developed.

## Commands

`$list` : Responses list of keywords.

`$quote <keyword>` : Responses a random quote about keyword

## Replit

Replit is a coding platform that lets you write code and host apps. It also has many educational features built-in, making it great for teachers and learners too.

You can host anything on Replit, from your basic personal website to a full web application for your startup. Any project you create can be deployed instantly to a temporary domain so you can share with friends or colleagues and get feedback, or permanently to an 'Always On' repl with a custom domain for a production environment.
